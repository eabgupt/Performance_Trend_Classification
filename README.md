# Performance_Trend_Classification
The project that i worked on for my Data Science Practicum is termed as Performance Trend Classification. The intention of the project is to look at a performance trend and classify the trend into three categories which are Improved , Degraded and Neutral.
For my Project i used CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to do the classification task. Multiple models which included Sequential API , Functional API , Transfer Learning- VGG16 and InceptionV3 were built to achieve higher accuracy. VGG16 model gave the best accuracy of 86.5%.
